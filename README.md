# Wine Data Analysis and Visualization
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA), dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and visualization techniques applied to the Wine dataset. The analysis includes understanding the distribution of chemical attributes in the dataset, exploring correlations between features, and visualizing the dataset using heatmaps.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains chemical analysis results of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The dataset has the following attributes:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline
